# Mirrored state

A mirror is a versioned authoritative backend snapshot plus an invalidation-only watch. Watch events
are not an event log; clients refetch the latest snapshot.

## Definition and identity

One definition owns the state schema, error schema, and typed Get RPC. The Get RPC tag is the sole
mirror identity and client reactivity key. Encoded schemas are JSON-safe.

## Updates

State and revision commit atomically. A semantic change increments revision once, stores the new
snapshot, then publishes `{ Get-RPC tag, revision }`. A no-op publishes nothing.

The shared watch is bounded and coalescing, so intermediate revisions may be skipped. Subscription
keepalives are consumed below the domain stream. Initial connection and reconnection invalidate all
currently consumed mirrors.

## Ownership

ACN owns the public product mirrors: `ProviderModelCatalog`, `LocalModels`, `ModelSlots`,
`LocalInferenceHardware`, and `Onboarding`. `LocalModels` is the stable target-level product
projection; package,
download-attempt, and recommendation working state remain private ACN observations. Private ICN
types and native field names do not cross the protocol boundary. A backend may bind directly only
when it owns the exact public schema and versioned replay.

`ModelSlots` also carries the provider-qualified model preferences needed to present model
selection, including favorites and recency. Preference mutations durably commit before the mirror
publishes the new snapshot.

Client-common owns one watch per client connection and all query invalidation. Query atoms remain
distinct by Get RPC tag, and clients retain each query's waiting, failure, and success Result
independently. Screens may derive presentation from successful domain values; they do not combine
domain Results into an aggregate authority, reconstruct state, or open their own operation streams.

A mirrored nonterminal state is valid only while its owning backend service has a live operation
capable of terminalizing it. The initiating RPC and its progress stream are never the owner.
Disconnecting every client does not alter admitted shared work; a later client receives the same
authoritative current snapshot.
