# Release platform contracts

A platform contract defines what a customer machine may be required to provide. Release artifacts
must not depend on anything else.

## Dependency ownership

Every native dependency belongs to exactly one class:

- **Artifact-owned:** shipped in the selected archive set, integrity-covered, and resolved through
  installation-relative loader paths.
- **Platform-owned:** part of the declared operating-system ABI for that host target.
- **Capability-owned:** supplied by a selected accelerator environment, such as an NVIDIA driver,
  Vulkan loader, or Metal framework.

An unclassified dependency is a release defect. Build tools, SDKs, package-manager prefixes,
compiler runtimes outside the declared platform ABI, ambient search paths, and files from the build
machine are never customer dependencies.

## Common runtime facilities

Every supported host must provide:

- a writable per-user data directory that supports atomic rename and execution of installed native
  files;
- ordinary child-process creation and a long-lived background ACN process;
- local loopback TCP sockets for client, ACN, and ICN communication; and
- DNS, trusted certificate roots, and outbound HTTPS for initial artifact acquisition and repair.

Once a complete installation is cached, release acquisition does not require network access. Model
acquisition has its own network requirements.

Customer systems do not need Rust, Bun, CMake, C/C++ compilers, CUDA toolkits, Vulkan SDKs,
developer headers, OpenSSL packages, OpenMP packages, or build-system package-manager prefixes.
The npm launcher requires its supported Node.js runtime, but acquired native artifacts do not use
Node.js as a native dependency.

## GNU Linux contract

Both `linux-x64-gnu` and `linux-arm64-gnu` target Ubuntu 22.04-compatible userspace.

| Property | x64 | arm64 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ELF class | ELF64 | ELF64 |
| Machine | x86-64 | AArch64 |
| Interpreter | `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` | `/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1` |
| Maximum glibc requirement | `GLIBC_2.35` | `GLIBC_2.35` |
| Maximum libstdc++ requirement | `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` | `GLIBCXX_3.4.30` |

Linux artifacts may dynamically require only these platform libraries:

- `libc.so.6`
- `libdl.so.2`
- `libgcc_s.so.1`
- `libm.so.6`
- `libpthread.so.0`
- `libresolv.so.2`
- `librt.so.1`
- `libstdc++.so.6`
- `libutil.so.1`

A CUDA composition may additionally require driver-owned `libcuda.so.1`. A Vulkan composition may
additionally require loader-owned `libvulkan.so.1`. CPU compositions may require neither. CUDA
toolkit libraries required at runtime are artifact-owned and shipped in the CUDA pack.

Linux executables resolve owned libraries from `../runtime`; libraries and backend modules resolve
from their own directory or `../runtime`. Allowed loader paths are therefore `$ORIGIN` and
`$ORIGIN/../runtime`. Releases must not require `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

## Apple contract

Apple artifacts may depend on operating-system libraries and frameworks included with the supported
macOS deployment target. Metal is capability-owned by macOS. Homebrew, MacPorts, Xcode, standalone
SDKs, and developer-tool libraries are not platform dependencies.

Artifact-owned libraries use `@loader_path` or declared installation rpaths and must not require
`DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Every Mach-O image must match its target architecture and must not declare a
deployment target newer than the supported macOS floor. The release configuration must name that
floor before minimum-version compatibility can be claimed; a runner label alone is not a support
contract.

## Required guarantees

- Build-host contents cannot introduce a dependency or raise a platform floor.
- Every non-platform dependency is shipped when redistribution permits; otherwise it is an explicit
  capability dependency checked before backend selection.
- Base and accelerator artifacts for one host share the same platform contract.
- Dynamic-loader failure remains distinct from protocol-decoding failure and retains bounded native
  diagnostics.
