## Core Concepts

### Events vs Signals

| Aspect | Events | Signals |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Persistence** | Persisted to EventSink | Ephemeral, never persisted |
| **Replay** | Replayed during hydration | Not replayed |
| **Source** | Workers (async), external | Projections only (sync) |
| **Consumers** | Projections and Workers | Projections and Workers |
| **Purpose** | Facts that happened | Derived notifications |

### Projections vs Workers

| Aspect | Projections | Workers |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **State** | Stateful (SubscriptionRef) | Stateless |
| **Execution** | Synchronous | Asynchronous (forked fibers) |
| **Can Publish Events** | No | Yes |
| **Can Emit Signals** | Yes | No |
| **Runs During Hydration** | Yes (rebuilds state) | No (skipped) |

## Component Deep Dive

### EventBusCore

**Location:** `src/core/event-bus-core.ts`

The central coordinator that orchestrates all event publishing:

```typescript
interface EventBusCoreService<E extends BaseEvent> {
  publish: (event: E) => Effect.Effect<void>
  subscribeToTypes: <T extends E['type']>(types: readonly T[]) => Stream.Stream<Extract<E, { type: T }>>
  stream: Stream.Stream<E>
}
```

**Responsibilities:**
1. Delegates projection handling to ProjectionBus (synchronous, two-phase)
2. Persists events to EventSink (skipped during hydration)
3. Broadcasts events to workers via PubSub (skipped during hydration)
4. Handles interrupt signal broadcasting

**Critical Implementation Detail:**
```typescript
publish: (event: E) => Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Phase 1 & 2: Synchronous projection processing
  yield* projectionBus.processEvent(event)

  // Skip side-effects during hydration
  if (yield* hydration.isHydrating()) {
    return
  }

  // Broadcast interrupt before persistence
  if (event.type === 'interrupt') {
    yield* PubSub.publish(interruptCoordinator, undefined)
  }

  // Persist and broadcast
  yield* sink.append(event)
  yield* PubSub.publish(pubsub, event)
})
```

### ProjectionBus

**Location:** `src/core/projection-bus.ts`

Handles **all** synchronous projection communication:

```typescript
interface ProjectionBusService<E extends BaseEvent> {
  register: (handler, eventTypes, name) => Effect.Effect<void>
  registerSignalHandler: (signalName, handler, projectionName) => Effect.Effect<void>
  queueSignal: (signalName, value, sourceState) => Effect.Effect<void>
  processEvent: (event: E) => Effect.Effect<void>
}
```

**Key Data Structures:**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ProjectionBus {
        -eventHandlersRef: Ref~EventHandlerItem[]~
        -signalHandlersRef: Ref~Map~string, SignalHandlerItem[]~~
        -signalQueueRef: Ref~QueuedSignal[]~
        +register(handler, types, name)
        +registerSignalHandler(signalName, handler, name)
        +queueSignal(signalName, value, sourceState)
        +processEvent(event)
    }

    class EventHandlerItem {
        name: string
        eventTypes: string[]
        handler: function
    }

    class SignalHandlerItem {
        name: string
        handler: function
    }

    class QueuedSignal {
        signalName: string
        value: unknown
        sourceState: unknown
    }

    ProjectionBus --> EventHandlerItem
    ProjectionBus --> SignalHandlerItem
    ProjectionBus --> QueuedSignal
```

### WorkerBus

**Location:** `src/core/worker-bus.ts`

A facade over EventBusCore that provides the worker-appropriate API:

```typescript
interface WorkerBusService<E extends BaseEvent> {
  publish: (event: E) => Effect.Effect<void>
  subscribeToTypes: <T extends E['type']>(types: readonly T[]) => Stream.Stream<Extract<E, { type: T }>>
  stream: Stream.Stream<E>
}
```

Workers cannot register synchronous handlers - they only publish events and subscribe to streams.

### EventSink

**Location:** `src/core/event-sink.ts`

Pending events buffer for persistence:

```typescript
interface EventSinkService {
  append: (event: BaseEvent) => Effect.Effect<void>
  claimPending: () => Effect.Effect<PendingEventClaim, never, Scope.Scope>
}

interface PendingEventClaim {
  events: ReadonlyArray<BaseEvent>
  acknowledge: Effect.Effect<void>
}
```

Used for:
- Accumulating new events since last persistence
- Granting one persistence worker exclusive ownership of a stable pending prefix
- Removing only the exact claimed prefix after the persistence commit succeeds

The claim's scope owns the exclusive flush permit. Closing it without acknowledgement leaves every
claimed event pending. Events appended while a claim is open remain after that claim is
acknowledged.

### HydrationContext

**Location:** `src/core/hydration-context.ts`

Tracks whether the system is in hydration (replay) mode:

```typescript
interface HydrationContextService {
  isHydrating: () => Effect.Effect<boolean>
  setHydrating: (value: boolean) => Effect.Effect<void>
}
```

When `isHydrating = true`:
- Events are NOT appended to EventSink
- Events are NOT broadcast to PubSub
- Workers are NOT started
- Projections still process events (to rebuild state)

### InterruptCoordinator

**Location:** `src/core/interrupt-coordinator.ts`

Broadcast channel for interrupt signals:

```typescript
const InterruptCoordinator = Context.GenericTag<PubSub.PubSub<void>>('InterruptCoordinator')
```

Workers race their handlers against this signal for automatic interruption.

## Event Processing Mechanics

### Event Flow Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant EBC as EventBusCore
    participant PB as ProjectionBus
    participant P1 as Projection1
    participant P2 as Projection2
    participant ES as EventSink
    participant PS as PubSub
    participant W as Workers

    C->>EBC: publish(event)

    Note over EBC,P2: Phase 1: Event Handlers
    EBC->>PB: processEvent(event)
    PB->>P1: handler(event)
    P1->>P1: update state
    P1->>PB: queueSignal(sig1, val, state)
    PB->>P2: handler(event)
    P2->>P2: update state

    Note over PB,P2: Phase 2: Signal Flush Loop
    loop Until queue empty (max 100)
        PB->>PB: get queued signals
        PB->>P1: signalHandler(val, sourceState)
        PB->>P2: signalHandler(val, sourceState)
    end

    PB-->>EBC: processEvent complete

    alt Not Hydrating
        EBC->>ES: append(event)
        EBC->>PS: publish(event)
        PS->>W: stream delivers event
    end
```

### Event Handler Registration

Projections register their event handlers during layer construction:

```typescript
// In Projection.define() Layer construction
yield* bus.register(eventHandler, eventTypes, serviceName)
```

**Registration Order:**
- Handlers are stored in an array in **registration order**
- Registration order follows **Effect's layer build order**
- Layer dependencies ensure correct ordering: if Projection B subscribes to Projection A's signal, A's layer is built first, so A's handlers run first

### Event Handler Execution

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[processEvent called] --> B[Get handlers from Ref]
    B --> C{For each handler}
    C --> D{Event type matches?}
    D -->|Yes| E[yield* handler event]
    D -->|No| F[Skip]
    E --> G[Handler updates state]
    G --> H[Handler may emit signals]
    H --> I[Signals queued to signalQueueRef]
    F --> C
    I --> C
    C -->|Done| J[Phase 2: Flush Signals]
```

## Signal Processing Mechanics

### Signal Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Signal Definition"
        SD[SignalDef<T>] -->|fromDef| S[Signal<T, TSourceState>]
        S --> Tag[Context.Tag<PubSub<T>>]
    end

    subgraph "Emission Path"
        P[Projection] -->|emit.signalName| EF[Emit Function]
        EF -->|queues| Q[pendingSignalEffects]
        Q -->|flush| BQ[bus.queueSignal]
        BQ -->|stored in| SQ[signalQueueRef]
    end

    subgraph "Async Path (Workers)"
        EF -->|also| PS[PubSub.publish]
        PS -->|stream| W[Worker]
    end
```

### Signal Flow - Synchronous Path (Projections)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P1 as Projection1
    participant EF as EmitFunction
    participant PE as pendingEffects
    participant BQ as bus.queueSignal
    participant SQ as signalQueueRef
    participant PB as ProjectionBus
    participant P2 as Projection2

    Note over P1: In event handler
    P1->>EF: emit.mySignal(value)
    EF->>PE: push Effect
    Note over P1: Handler returns new state

    Note over P1,PE: After handler returns
    P1->>PE: flushPendingSignals
    PE->>BQ: for each: queueSignal
    BQ->>SQ: Ref.update (append)

    Note over PB: Phase 2 Flush
    PB->>SQ: Ref.getAndSet([])
    loop For each queued signal
        PB->>P2: signalHandler(value, sourceState)
        Note over P2: May emit more signals
    end
```

### Signal Flow - Asynchronous Path (Workers)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Projection
    participant PS as Signal PubSub
    participant W as Worker

    Note over P: In emit function
    P->>PS: PubSub.publish(value)

    Note over W: Running in separate fiber
    PS->>W: Stream delivers value
    W->>W: handler(value, publish)
    W->>W: May publish events
```

### Signal Handler Registration

Signal handlers are registered during projection layer construction:

```typescript
yield* bus.registerSignalHandler(
  signal.name,
  (value, sourceState) => Effect.gen(function* () {
    yield* SubscriptionRef.update(stateRef, (currentState) =>
      handler({ value, source: sourceState, state: currentState, emit: typedEmitters })
    )
    yield* flushPendingSignals
  }),
  serviceName
)
```

**Key Points:**
- Signal handlers receive the **source projection's state** at emission time
- Handlers can emit additional signals (cascading)
- All signal handling is synchronous within the event processing

---

## Two-Phase Processing Model

This is the **critical architectural decision** that prevents race conditions:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph "Phase 1: Event Handlers"
        E1[Event arrives]
        E2[Handler 1 runs]
        E3[Handler 2 runs]
        E4[Handler N runs]

        E1 --> E2 --> E3 --> E4

        E2 -.->|emits| Q1[Queue]
        E3 -.->|emits| Q1
        E4 -.->|emits| Q1
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Signal Flush"
        F1[Get queued signals]
        F2[Clear queue]
        F3[Run signal handlers]
        F4{More signals?}
        F5[Done]

        F1 --> F2 --> F3 --> F4
        F4 -->|Yes| F1
        F4 -->|No| F5
    end

    E4 --> F1
```

### Why Two Phases?

**Problem with immediate dispatch:**
```
Event E arrives
  → Projection A handles E, emits Signal S, updates state to A1
  → Signal S dispatched immediately
    → Projection B handles S, sees A1
  → Projection B handles E, updates state to B1
    → But B already handled S based on A1!
```

**Solution with two phases:**
```
Event E arrives
  Phase 1:
    → Projection A handles E, emits Signal S (queued), updates to A1
    → Projection B handles E, updates to B1

  Phase 2:
    → Signal S dispatched
    → All projections see final state (A1, B1)
    → Signal handlers have consistent view
```

### Iteration Safety

The flush loop has a safety limit:

```typescript
let iterations = 0
const maxIterations = 100

while (true) {
  const queue = yield* Ref.getAndSet(signalQueueRef, [])
  if (queue.length === 0) break

  if (iterations++ >= maxIterations) {
    yield* Effect.logWarning(`Signal flush exceeded ${maxIterations} iterations`)
    break
  }
  // ... process signals
}
```

This prevents infinite loops from circular signal cascades.

---

## Ordering Guarantees

### Event Handler Ordering

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Registration Order = Execution Order"
        R1[Projection A registers]
        R2[Projection B registers]
        R3[Projection C registers]

        R1 --> R2 --> R3
    end

    subgraph "On Event"
        E1[A.handler]
        E2[B.handler]
        E3[C.handler]

        E1 --> E2 --> E3
    end
```

**Guarantee:** Event handlers execute in registration order, which follows Effect's layer build order.

**Layer Dependencies Control Order:**
```typescript
// If B depends on A's signal:
const B = Projection.define<Event, State>()({
  signalHandlers: [
    Signal.projectOn(A.signals.changed, handler)
  ]
})

// A's Layer builds before B's Layer
// Therefore A registers handlers before B
// Therefore A's event handlers run before B's
```

### Signal Handler Ordering

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Per Signal Name"
        S1[Signal X emitted]
        H1[Handler 1 for X]
        H2[Handler 2 for X]
        H3[Handler 3 for X]

        S1 --> H1 --> H2 --> H3
    end
```

**Guarantee:** Signal handlers for the same signal execute in registration order.

### Cross-Event Ordering

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant E as EventBusCore

    C->>E: publish(Event1)
    Note over E: Event1 fully processed
    Note over E: All projections updated
    Note over E: All signals flushed
    E-->>C: returns

    C->>E: publish(Event2)
    Note over E: Event2 sees final state from Event1
```

**Guarantee:** Each event is fully processed (including all signal cascades) before `publish` returns.

---

## Race Condition Analysis

### Can Race Conditions Occur?

#### Signal Handler vs Signal Handler: **NO**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S1[Signal S emitted]
    H1[Handler 1]
    H2[Handler 2]
    H3[Handler 3]

    S1 --> H1
    H1 -->|completes| H2
    H2 -->|completes| H3

    style H1 fill:#90EE90
    style H2 fill:#90EE90
    style H3 fill:#90EE90
```

**Why:** All signal handlers run sequentially within the same Effect fiber. Each `yield*` completes before the next handler starts.

#### Event Handler vs Event Handler: **NO**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E1[Event arrives]
    H1[Projection A handler]
    H2[Projection B handler]

    E1 --> H1
    H1 -->|completes| H2

    style H1 fill:#90EE90
    style H2 fill:#90EE90
```

**Why:** Event handlers run in a synchronous `for` loop with `yield*`:

```typescript
for (const { eventTypes, handler } of handlers) {
  if (eventTypes.includes(event.type)) {
    yield* handler(event)  // Waits for completion
  }
}
```

#### Signal Handler vs Event Handler: **NO**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E1[Event arrives]

    subgraph "Phase 1"
        EH1[Event Handler A]
        EH2[Event Handler B]
        EH1 --> EH2
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2"
        SH1[Signal Handler A]
        SH2[Signal Handler B]
        SH1 --> SH2
    end

    E1 --> EH1
    EH2 -->|"Phase 1 complete"| SH1

    style EH1 fill:#90EE90
    style EH2 fill:#90EE90
    style SH1 fill:#87CEEB
    style SH2 fill:#87CEEB
```

**Why:** The two-phase model completely separates event and signal processing. Phase 1 (event handlers) must complete entirely before Phase 2 (signal handlers) begins.

#### Worker vs Worker: **CONCURRENT (By Design)**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    E1[Event published to PubSub]
    W1[Worker 1 Fiber]
    W2[Worker 2 Fiber]

    E1 --> W1
    E1 --> W2

    style W1 fill:#FFB6C1
    style W2 fill:#FFB6C1
```

**Why:** Workers run in separate forked fibers. This is intentional - workers are async and can run concurrently.

**Mitigations:**
1. Workers should be stateless
2. Workers publish events, which are processed synchronously by projections
3. Event ordering provides serialization point

#### Worker vs Projection: **SAFE**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant W as Worker (Fiber)
    participant E as EventBusCore
    participant P as Projection

    W->>E: publish(event)
    Note over E: Synchronous processing
    E->>P: processEvent
    P->>P: Update state
    E-->>W: publish returns

    Note over W,P: Worker sees updated state
    W->>P: read state
```

**Why:** When a worker publishes an event, it waits for `publish` to return. By that time, all projections have processed the event synchronously.

### The Synchronous Guarantee

**The fundamental invariant:**

> All projection state updates from an event (including signal cascades) complete synchronously before the `publish` call returns.

This means:
- Any code that awaits `publish` can immediately read consistent projection state
- Workers reading projection state always see the result of all events they've published
- There's no "eventual consistency" delay within a single publish call

### Potential Race: Worker PubSub Subscription

**Scenario:**
```typescript
// Worker subscribes to signal
yield* Effect.forkScoped(
  Stream.runForEach(
    Stream.fromPubSub(pubsub),
    (value) => handler(value, publish)
  )
)
```

**The PubSub subscription happens at layer construction time.** If a signal is emitted before the worker's stream loop starts processing, it could be missed.

**Mitigation in practice:**
1. Layers are built in dependency order
2. Workers depend on projections (to subscribe to their signals)
3. By the time events flow, workers are subscribed

---

## Hydration and Replay

### Hydration Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant DB as Database
    participant HC as HydrationContext
    participant EBC as EventBusCore
    participant P as Projections
    participant W as Workers

    DB->>HC: setHydrating(true)

    loop For each stored event
        DB->>EBC: publish(event)
        EBC->>P: processEvent(event)
        Note over P: State rebuilt
        Note over EBC: No EventSink append
        Note over EBC: No PubSub broadcast
    end

    DB->>HC: setHydrating(false)

    Note over W: Now workers start
    Note over EBC: New events are persisted
```

### What Happens During Hydration

| Component | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Event Handlers** | Run normally, rebuild state |
| **Signal Handlers** | Run normally (part of event processing) |
| **EventSink.append** | Skipped |
| **PubSub.publish** | Skipped |
| **Worker startup** | Skipped (check `isHydrating` in Layer) |
| **Interrupt broadcast** | Skipped |

### Worker Hydration Guard

```typescript
const WorkerLayer = Layer.scoped(Tag, Effect.gen(function* () {
  const hydration = yield* HydrationContext

  if (yield* hydration.isHydrating()) {
    return  // Don't start worker during hydration
  }

  // ... normal worker setup
}))
```

---

## Layer Composition

### The Agent Layer Stack

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "User Provides"
        External[External Requirements]
    end

    subgraph "Agent Composes"
        subgraph "Core Deps"
            HC[HydrationContext]
            ES[EventSink]
            IPS[InterruptCoordinator]
        end

        subgraph "Bus Stack"
            PB[ProjectionBus]
            EBC[EventBusCore]
            WB[WorkerBus]
        end

        subgraph "Application"
            P1[Projection 1]
            P2[Projection 2]
            W1[Worker 1]
            W2[Worker 2]
        end
    end

    HC --> EBC
    ES --> EBC
    IPS --> EBC
    PB --> EBC
    EBC --> WB

    PB --> P1
    PB --> P2

    WB --> W1
    WB --> W2
    P1 --> W1
    P2 --> W1

    External --> W1
    External --> W2
```

### Layer Build Order

Effect builds layers based on dependencies:

```typescript
const AppLayer = Layer.provideMerge(
  WorkersLayer,
  Layer.provideMerge(ProjectionsLayer, BaseLayer)
)
```

**Build order:**
1. CoreDeps (HydrationContext, EventSink, InterruptCoordinator)
2. ProjectionBus
3. EventBusCore (depends on ProjectionBus + CoreDeps)
4. WorkerBus (depends on EventBusCore)
5. Projections (in dependency order based on signal subscriptions)
6. Workers (depend on projections for signal PubSubs)

### Signal PubSub Layers

Each projection creates PubSub layers for its signals:

```typescript
// In Projection.define()
for (const [, signal] of signalEntries) {
  const signalLayer = Layer.scoped(signal.tag, PubSub.unbounded<unknown>())
  SignalPubSubLayers = Layer.merge(SignalPubSubLayers, signalLayer)
}

const FullLayer = Layer.provideMerge(LogicLayer, SignalPubSubLayers)
```

This ensures:
- Each signal has exactly one PubSub instance
- Workers can subscribe to these PubSubs
- The PubSub is scoped to the agent's lifetime

---

## Summary: Key Architectural Invariants

1. **Synchronous Projection Processing**: All event handlers and signal handlers run synchronously within `processEvent`. No concurrency within projection logic.

2. **Two-Phase Separation**: Event handlers (Phase 1) complete entirely before signal handlers (Phase 2) run. This prevents seeing inconsistent intermediate states.

3. **Registration Order = Execution Order**: Handlers run in the order they were registered, which follows Effect's deterministic layer build order.

4. **Hydration Isolation**: During replay, only projection state is rebuilt. Side effects (persistence, worker execution) are skipped.

5. **Worker Concurrency is Intentional**: Workers run in separate fibers and can be concurrent. This is safe because:
   - Workers are stateless
   - Workers serialize through event publishing
   - Each `publish` call is synchronous for projections

6. **Signal Cascade Safety**: Signal handlers can emit more signals, which are processed in the same flush cycle. A maximum iteration limit prevents infinite loops.

7. **Source State Capture**: Signals capture the emitting projection's state at emission time, ensuring signal handlers have consistent context even if the source projection updates later in the same event.

**Location:** `src/fsm/define.ts`

Type-safe state machines using Effect's `Data.TaggedClass`:

```typescript
const ResponseFSM = FSM.define({
  transitions: {
    pending: ['streaming'],
    streaming: ['completed'],
    completed: []
  } as const,
  states: [Pending, Streaming, Completed]
})
```

**Key Features:**
- Compile-time transition validation
- `transition()` - move to new state with required fields
- `hold()` - stay in current state with updated data
- `isTerminal()` - check if state has no outgoing transitions

### Forked Projections

**Location:** `src/projection/defineForked.ts`

Projections with per-fork state partitioning:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "ForkedProjection State"
        M[Map<forkId, ForkState>]
        R[root/null → ForkState]
        F1[fork1 → ForkState]
        F2[fork2 → ForkState]
        M --> R
        M --> F1
        M --> F2
    end

    subgraph "Event Processing"
        E[Event with forkId]
        H[Handler receives fork state]
        U[Updates only that fork]

        E --> H --> U
    end
```

**Use Case:** Agent forking where each fork needs independent state (e.g., conversation memory).

```typescript
const MemoryProjection = Projection.defineForked<MyEvent, ForkMemoryState>()({
  name: 'Memory',
  initialFork: { messages: [] },

  eventHandlers: {
    user_message: ({ event, fork }) => ({
      ...fork,
      messages: [...fork.messages, event.message]
    })
  }
})
```

### Flow System

**Location:** `src/flow/define.ts`, `src/flow/types.ts`

Imperative orchestration for complex workflows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant W as FlowWorker
    participant P as FlowProjection
    participant Ctx as FlowContext

    C->>W: flow_started event
    W->>P: updateState(initial)
    W->>W: fork fiber for run()

    loop Flow Execution
        W->>Ctx: ctx.effect(sideEffect)
        Ctx->>Ctx: Check history
        alt First run
            Ctx->>Ctx: Execute effect
            Ctx->>C: Emit result event
        else Replay
            Ctx->>Ctx: Return cached result
        end

        W->>Ctx: ctx.transition(state, target, data)
        Ctx->>P: updateState(newState)

        W->>Ctx: ctx.waitFor(['event_type'])
        Ctx->>Ctx: Check history or subscribe
    end
```

**Key Concepts:**

1. **ctx.effect()** - Wrap side effects for deterministic replay
2. **ctx.spawn()** - Create child flows
3. **ctx.waitFor()** - Wait for external events
4. **ctx.transition()** - FSM state transitions with signals

**Replay Safety:** All side effects are recorded as events. On replay:
- `ctx.effect()` returns cached results
- `ctx.spawn()` reconnects to existing children
- `ctx.waitFor()` checks event history first

### Display System

**Location:** `src/display/define.ts`

Derived UI state from projections:

```typescript
const MyDisplay = Display.define({
  name: 'Status',
  source: MyProjection.Tag,
  derive: (projection) => Effect.gen(function* () {
    const state = yield* projection.get
    return { isLoading: state.status === 'pending' }
  }),
  options: {
    debounce: '100 millis'  // Optional debouncing
  }
})
```

**Use Case:** Transform projection state into UI-friendly format with optional debouncing.

### Interrupt System

**Location:** `src/core/interrupt-coordinator.ts`, `src/worker/define.ts`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant EBC as EventBusCore
    participant IPS as InterruptCoordinator
    participant W1 as Worker1 Handler
    participant W2 as Worker2 Handler

    C->>EBC: publish({type: 'interrupt'})
    EBC->>IPS: PubSub.publish(void)

    par Racing
        IPS->>W1: interrupt signal
        W1->>W1: Effect.interrupt
    and
        IPS->>W2: interrupt signal
        W2->>W2: Effect.interrupt
    end

    Note over W1,W2: Handlers interrupted
    Note over W1,W2: Stream loops continue
```

**Worker Implementation:**
```typescript
const withInterrupt = <A, RH>(handler: Effect.Effect<A, never, RH>) =>
  Effect.scoped(
    Effect.gen(function* () {
      const queue = yield* PubSub.subscribe(interruptCoordinator)
      return yield* Effect.raceFirst(
        handler,
        Stream.fromQueue(queue).pipe(
          Stream.take(1),
          Stream.runDrain,
          Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.interrupt)
        )
      )
    })
  )
```

**Key Points:**
- Each handler gets a fresh subscription (only sees interrupts after it starts)
- Interruption is caught so the stream loop continues
- Some event types can opt out via `ignoreInterrupt` config

            W->>W: Handler runs in fiber
            W->>EBC: May publish more events
        and
            SPS->>W: Stream delivers signals
            W->>W: Signal handler runs
        end
    end

    EBC-->>Client: publish returns
```

## Appendix: Type System

### Generic Event Bus Tags

The system uses generic tag factories to maintain type safety:

```typescript
// Each creates a unique tag for the specific event type
const EventBusCoreTag = <E extends BaseEvent>() =>
  Context.GenericTag<EventBusCoreService<E>>('EventBusCore')

const ProjectionBusTag = <E extends BaseEvent>() =>
  Context.GenericTag<ProjectionBusService<E>>('ProjectionBus')

const WorkerBusTag = <E extends BaseEvent>() =>
  Context.GenericTag<WorkerBusService<E>>('WorkerBus')
```

### Signal Type Flow

```
SignalDef<T>           // Input: just name + phantom type
    ↓ fromDef()
Signal<T, TSourceState> // Output: includes source projection's state type
    ↓ .tag
Context.Tag<PubSub<T>> // Runtime: identifies the PubSub
```

### Projection Type Extraction

```typescript
// From config
ProjectionConfig<TName, TState, TEvent, TSignalDefs, TSignalHandlers>

// To result
ProjectionResult<...> {
  Tag: Context.Tag<ProjectionInstance<TState>>
  Layer: Layer.Layer<
    ProjectionInstance<TState> | SignalPubSubs<...>,
    never,
    ProjectionBusService<TEvent> | SignalRequirements<...>
  >
  signals: AttachSourceState<TSignalDefs, TState>
}
```

## Appendix: Common Patterns

### Projection → Signal → Worker Flow

```typescript
// 1. Projection emits signal when state changes
const TaskProjection = Projection.define<Event, TaskState>()({
  name: 'Task',
  signals: { completed: Signal.create<Task>('Task/completed') },
  eventHandlers: {
    task_finished: ({ event, state, emit }) => {
      const task = state.tasks.get(event.id)
      emit.completed(task)
      return { ...state, tasks: new Map(state.tasks).set(event.id, { ...task, done: true }) }
    }
  }
})

// 2. Worker reacts to signal
const NotifyWorker = Worker.define<Event>()({
  name: 'Notify',
  signalHandlers: [
    Signal.workOn(TaskProjection.signals.completed, (task, publish) =>
      Effect.gen(function* () {
        yield* sendNotification(task)
        yield* publish({ type: 'notification_sent', taskId: task.id })
      })
    )
  ]
})
```

### Projection → Signal → Projection Flow

```typescript
// 1. Source projection emits signal
const SourceProjection = Projection.define<Event, SourceState>()({
  signals: { dataReady: Signal.create<Data>('Source/dataReady') },
  // ...
})

// 2. Derived projection subscribes to signal
const DerivedProjection = Projection.define<Event, DerivedState>()({
  signalHandlers: [
    Signal.projectOn(SourceProjection.signals.dataReady, ({ value, source, state, emit }) => ({
      ...state,
      derivedData: computeDerived(value, source)
    }))
  ]
})
```

### Event Sourcing Pattern

```typescript
// Events are the source of truth
type MyEvent =
  | { type: 'item_added'; id: string; data: ItemData }
  | { type: 'item_removed'; id: string }

// Projections derive state from events
const ItemsProjection = Projection.define<MyEvent, ItemsState>()({
  eventHandlers: {
    item_added: ({ event, state }) => ({
      items: new Map(state.items).set(event.id, event.data)
    }),
    item_removed: ({ event, state }) => {
      const items = new Map(state.items)
      items.delete(event.id)
      return { items }
    }
  }
})

// Hydration replays events to rebuild state
// Workers only run after hydration completes
```
