 * Core Concepts:
 * - Event: Persisted fact, replayed during hydration
 * - Signal: Ephemeral notification, NOT replayed
 * - FSM: Type-safe state machine with Data.TaggedClass
 * - Projection: Stateful handler for events + signals
 * - Worker: Stateless effect handler for events or signals
 * - EventEngine: Composition of projections and workers
